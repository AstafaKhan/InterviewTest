# InterviewTest


This project follows the MVVM architecture. I have implemented static images in the Top Category section, allowing users to swipe left and right. With each swipe, the product list updates based on the selected category.

In the product list, I have utilized a placeholder URL to simulate fetching the product data. However, the dataset is limited, so I have duplicated the entries to ensure smooth scrolling. Additionally, the search bar is constrained to stay within the top section.
